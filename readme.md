# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in the web browser using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic and interactivity. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol (usually X or O).

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser or opern url (https://jazzy-jalebi-8480a8.netlify.app/)
2. The game will start automatically.
3. Players take turns clicking on empty spaces on the grid to place their symbol (X or O).
4. The first player to form a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol wins the game.
5. If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
6. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game at any time.
